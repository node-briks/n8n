Dear Nodebriks Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

Please find attached the detailed project document for our upcoming initiative “Project Veritas: An AI-Powered Fake Review Detection System for E-Commerce.”

This system is intended to help us automatically detect and reduce fraudulent product reviews using a hybrid AI/ML approach leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and behavioral analysis. The document outlines the following:

- Executive summary and objectives
- Scope and feature requirements
- Technical architecture and methodology
- Phased implementation plan
- Evaluation metrics and ethical considerations

We’d like you to review the document thoroughly and come back with your implementation approach, estimated timelines, and cost breakdown.

Looking forward to your response so that we can move this project into the next phase.

Best regards,
David Johnson
